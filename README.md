# MoE firmware

Firmware for MoE devices developed as a Bachelor's project. MoE stands for MIDI over Ethernet – these devices can adapt MIDI for uasge in LAN. It also adds 
advanced routing in terms of MIDI channels of each device. MoE devices are controled via <a href="https://github.com/woeetech/MoE_network_driver">MoE Network Driver </a>. 

This device was prototyped on Arduino UNO with WizNet Ethernet Shield as depicted below:

For the final product a custom PCB was created, no photograph of the device was taken sadly.
