# MoE firmware

Firmware for MoE devices developed as a Bachelor's project. MoE stands for MIDI over Ethernet â€“ these devices can adapt MIDI for usage in LAN. It also adds 
advanced routing in terms of MIDI channels of each device. MoE devices are controled via <a href="https://github.com/woeetech/MoE_network_driver">MoE Network Driver </a>. 

This device was prototyped on Arduino UNO with WizNet Ethernet Shield as depicted below:

For the final product a custom PCB was created, no photograph of the device was taken sadly. It used ATmega3208 and thanks to MCUdude's <a href="https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX">MegaCoreX</a> it could be programmed with Arduino IDE.
